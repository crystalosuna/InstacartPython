# InstacartPython
Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. This analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.
# Objective
My objective is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria. 
# Data
We were provided with four datasets that contained customer data:
  * Orders
  * Orders_products_prior
  * Products
  * Customers
# Folders
The analysis was seperated into five folders:
  * Project Management: Contains the Project Brief
  * Data: Separated into Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original dataframes and the dataframes after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. NOTE: This folder has not been included
  * Scripts: Contains all the Python coding involved for the entire analysis process
  * Analysis: Contains the Visualizations used for developing insights and presenting on the final report
  * Sent to client: The Final Report
